>Note: This is a thing to see if I can do it. It's only the second thing I've worked on using <a href="https://tonejs.github.io/">Tone.js</a>, but I think I like it so far. It may be the beginning of a few other things, but that will depend.

## Try it yourself

The large boxes under the melody and bass loops control the timbre of those sounds. They are connected to filters: drag the circle to the right or left to change one effect, up and down to change another. Click **Start** or press the **Space Bar** to play and pause the loop.

<div id="playButton">Start</div>

Drag the circle to add or remove distortion and delay to the melody synthesizer.

<div id="melodyLoop" class="loop"></div>

<div id="melodyEffects" class="effects"></div>

Drag the circle to add or remove "BitCrusher" and "Chorus" effects to the bass synthesizer.

<div id="bassLoop" class="loop"></div>

<div id="bassEffects" class="effects"></div>

<div id="drumLoop" class="loop"></div>
